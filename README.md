This is a React based app that uses react-leaflet components to display a map with markers, polylines and Polygons.
The map tiles used are good for showing routes and their elevation.
The package used for clustering markers is react-leaflet-markercluster.
All the geographic features are stored in a json file (\src\backcountry_beta.json) extracted to the Backcountry object.
